# Multicoil-ReconFormer
This repository contains a customized implementation of ReconFormerâ€”a transformer-based deep learning model for accelerated multicoil MRI reconstruction. We adapted the original ReconFormer architecture to support multicoil data by modifying the data loading and transformation modules from the original codebase.
